### Simple Script for Purging .DS_Store Files ###
Running this script without args will purge all .DS_Store files in ~/Sites/ which is where everyone in my company keeps their dev stuff.  

You can optionally run this with an argument that is the path to the desired directory to be purged of .DS_Store filed

Just a convenience tool and a work in progress
